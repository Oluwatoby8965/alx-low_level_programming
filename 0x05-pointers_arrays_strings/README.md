Tasks on -0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings projct on week#5:

    Requirements:
        Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
        All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
        All your files should end with a new line
        A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
        Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
        You are not allowed to use global variables
        No more than 5 functions per file
        You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etc… is forbidden
        You are allowed to use putchar
        You don’t have to push putchar.c, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account
        In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
        The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function putchar should be included in your header file called main.h
        Don’t forget to push your header file
